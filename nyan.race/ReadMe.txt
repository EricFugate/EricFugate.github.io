Description:
This web page is the final project of my Introduction to Web Development (CIS 370) course from Missouri State University.

The goal of the project was to use HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript knowledge gained from the course to create a web page that
races two images across the screen horizontally.

For this project, I wanted the web page to be scalable to fit a multitude of screen resolutions, so I scaled text, images, 
and the race mechanics to work with many resolutions.
